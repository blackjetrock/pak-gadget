Picopak V1.0 errata


1. Display connector needs to be rotated 180 degrees, also move in slightly [DONE]
2. Resistor and capacitor footprints are too small, 0603 only just fits  [Using smaller components.]
3. Notch missing [
4. Switch footprint slightly wrong, too large. [leaving as OK to build]
5. Attempt to power from slot connector, maybe 5V can be persuaded to be on permanently? Or switched differently? 
6. Pull up resistors both go to SDA [FIXED]
